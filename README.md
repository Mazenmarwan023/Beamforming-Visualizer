# 2D Beamforming Simulator

This project demonstrates 2D beamforming concepts for linear or curved phased arrays. 
It allows:

- Configuration of array parameters (number of elements, spacing, curvature) 
- Adjustment of frequency and position for each array
- Real-time beam steering visualization
- Interference pattern analysis

Run main.py to launch the simulator. 
Use the sliders and checkboxes to adjust array geometry and observe how beam patterns and interference maps change in real time. 
Scenarios can be saved or loaded via the scenario manager for quick configuration.
